# Purpose of the program

To create a project management system for a small structural
engineering firm called “Poised”. Poised does the engineering needed to ensure
the structural integrity of various buildings. They want you to create a Java
program that they can use to keep track of the many projects on which they work.

### How the program will be structured:

Capture information about new projects. If a project name is not provided
when the information is captured, name the project using the surname of
the customer. For example, a house being built by Mike Tyson would be called 
“House Tyson.” An apartment block owned by Jared Goldman would
be called “Apartment Goldman.”

Update information about existing projects. Information may need to be
adjusted at different stages throughout the lifecycle of a project. For
example, the deadline might change after a meeting with various
stakeholders.

Finalise existing projects. When a project is finalised, the following should
happen:

An invoice should be generated for the client. This invoice should
contain the customer’s contact details and the total amount that the
customer must still pay. This amount is calculated by subtracting the
total amount paid to date from the total fee for the project. If the
customer has already paid the full fee, an invoice should not be
generated.
